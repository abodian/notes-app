# Setting up a minimal frontend web application

Follow these instructions when setting up a new frontend web project. Your project will use the following tools and libraries:

- NPM to install dependencies.
- `jest` to write and run tests.
- `esbuild` to bundle JS source files.

### 1. Initialise the project directory

This assumes you have `NVM` already installed:

```bash
nvm use node
npm install -g jest esbuild

mkdir my-project-directory
cd my-project-directory/

npm init -y
npm install jest-environment-jsdom
```

### 2. Create files

```bash
touch index.js
touch index.html
```

### 3. Add the HTML scaffold on the page

You can find a lot of HTML "boilerplate" templates online ‚Äî here's one you can use in your `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />

    <title>My web page</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

Open the page in your browser:

```bash
open index.html
```

### 4. Add the `build` script to `package.json`

This is so we can run `npm run build` in our terminal to execute `esbuild` to bundle the code.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project-directory",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    // add this line:
    "build": "esbuild index.js --bundle  --outfile=bundle.js --watch"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

When we now run `npm run build`, the following command is executed for us by NPM:

```bash
$ esbuild index.js --bundle --outfile=bundle.js --watch
```

- `index.js` is the main file of our JavaScript program. In other words, is the
  file that _requires_ other files, but that is not required by any other.
- `bundle.js` is the name of the bundle file that will be loaded by the
  browser.
- the `--watch` option tells esbuild to automatically regenerate the bundle
  when we change source files.

You can now run `npm run build` and it should generate the file `bundle.js` ‚Äî leave the command running in a terminal somewhere, otherwise new changes made to your source files won't be watched.

### 5. Load the `bundle.js` file on the page

```html
<!-- add this line at the end of the body -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="bundle.js"></script>
```

### 6. Add files to `.gitignore` and commit your changes

```bash
echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore
echo "bundle.js" >> .gitignore

git init .
git add .
git commit -m "Project setup"
```

## Suggested project structure

There is no idiomatic project structure for JavaScript frontend projects ‚Äî it will depend heavily on the team, project domain, and/or the framework (or the absence of it).

Therefore, in this module we recommend sticking to a simple enough directory structure that we'd call "flat" ‚Äî keeping the nesting of directories to a minimum:

```
- my_todo_list_project
  - todoView.js
  - todoView.test.js
  - todoModel.js
  - todoModel.test.js
  - index.js
  - index.html
  - package.json
  - (other files...)
```

Something that is common enough in JS projects is to put all JavaScript files into a directory called `src/`:

```
- my_todo_list_project
  - src/
    - todoView.js
    - todoView.test.js
    - todoModel.js
    - todoModel.test.js
    - index.js
  - bundle.js
  - index.html
  - package.json
  - (other files...)
```

In that case, remember to update your `package.json` so `esbuild` has the right path to the `index.js` file:

```json
{
  "name": "notes",
  // (...)
  "scripts": {
    "build": "esbuild ./src/index.js --bundle  --outfile=bundle.js --watch"
  }
}
```

If you'd like to have a different structure with more directories, you might want to group them by "functionality", e.g have the "View" classes in a `views/` directory, for example.

```
- my_todo_list_project
  - src/
    - views/
      - todoView.js
      - todoView.test.js
    - models/
      - todoModel.js
      - todoModel.test.js
    - index.js
  - index.html
  - package.json
  - (other files...)
```

We recommend keeping the test files close to the source file they test (which is a different approach to other languages and test frameworks, like Ruby/RSpec) ‚Äî but if you'd like to put all your tests in a separate directory, you can also create a `__tests__` directory at the root of your project:

```
- my_todo_list_project
  - src/
    - views/
      - todoView.js
    - models/
      - todoModel.js
    - index.js
  - __tests__
    - todoView.test.js
    - todoModel.test.js
  - index.html
  - package.json
  - (other files...)
```

In case you have any other (non JavaScript) resources, such as CSS files, images, etc, they can probably be put into a different directory (usually called `assets`, `static` or `resources`, or something similar).

Once again, you shouldn't worry too much about having the "right" structure, as it will vary between teams and projects ‚Äî focus on having something consistent and that works for you, so you know where to find your files and how to require them without too much confusion.
